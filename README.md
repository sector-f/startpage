#startpage

I felt like making a start page, so I made a start page. It relies heavily on [flexboxes](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox), so don't expect it to work on old browsers. It does work surprisingly well in `links`, though. Personalizing the colors/links is trivial for anyone with rudimentary HTML/CSS knowledge.

Searchbar javascript was ~~stolen~~ copied/adapted from [Will Eccles' startpage](https://github.com/WillEccles/startpage).
